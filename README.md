Typewriter Bot Project
(Only for educational purposes)
Welcome to my homemade Typewriter Bot! Follow the instructions below to get started:

Instructions:

Install the Chrome browser.

Download Python 3.10 from the Microsoft Store.

Note: Do not use a web browser to download Python.

Install the required Python packages:

Open the command line (cmd) and enter the following commands:

pip install webdriver_manager

pip install selenium

Run the Typewriter Bot:

Click on the file Typewriter_Bot.exe.

Ensure it runs with Python 3.10.

Configure the Bot:
Wait for the bot to start up.
Set the speed (preferably fast).
Adjust the variation (0.2-0.3 is recommended; higher values make it less noticeable to a teacher but may slow the bot down).
Set the error rate (1% to 2% is recommended).
Log In:
Once the bot starts, a Chrome tab with the Typewriter website should open.
Quickly log in before the time runs out.
Enjoy using your Typewriter Bot!

Feel free to ask if you need any further assistance or modifications!

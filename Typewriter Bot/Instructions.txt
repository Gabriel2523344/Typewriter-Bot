Instructions:

Install the Chrome browser.
Download Python 3.10 from the Microsoft Store (do not use the browser!).
In the command line (cmd), enter pip install webdriver_manager.
In the command line (cmd), enter pip install selenium.
Click on the file Typewriter_Bot.exe and run it with Python 3.10.
Wait for the bot to start up.
Set the speed (preferably fast).
Adjust the variation (the more, the less noticeable it is to the teacher, but it usually makes the bot slower; 0.2-0.3 is recommended).
Set the error rate (between 1% and 2% is good).
After the bot starts, a Chrome tab with the Typewriter website should open. Quickly log in there (before the time runs out).
I hope you have fun with it!
